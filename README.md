# Ex1 

#Ex1
is an extetion of Ex0 , we implement tthe classes Complex_Funtion and Function_GUI.

#Monom class:
 *This class represents a simple "Monom" of shape a*x^b,
 where a is a real number and a is an integer (a none negative). 

#Polynom class:
This class represents a Polynom 
This interface represents a general Polynom: f(x) = a_1X^b_1 + a_2*X^b_2 ... a_n*Xb_n,
 * where: a_1, a_2 ... a_n are real numbers and b_1<b_2..<b_n are none negative integers (naturals)
with add, multiply  functionality, it also should support the following:
  1. Riemann's Integral: 
  2. Finding a numerical value between two values (currently 
  3. Derivative

#ComplexFunction class:
This cless represents a complex function:
operation(function f1,functionf2)
that the operation are : plus, multiply, divide, minimum, maximum, none, error.
function can be : monom, polynom or complex function. 

#Function_GUI:
this class represent a new collection of functions that can be save into a file, init from a file, and draw the collection of function.
