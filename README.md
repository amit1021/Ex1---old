 *1)Monom-  getting a String and makes it a Monom.
 *2) f(x) - calculate the value of the Monom in X0.
 *3)add - add two Monoms if their power are equals.
 *4)substract - substract Monom from  Monom if their power are equals.
 *5)multiply - multiply two Monoms.
 *6)equals - check if two Monoms are equals in the range of epsilon
